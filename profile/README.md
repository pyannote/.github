[**pyannote.audio**](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) is an open-source toolkit for speaker diarization.  

I propose (paid) scientific [consulting services](https://herve.niderb.fr/consulting.html) to companies willing to make the most of their data and open-source speech processing toolkits (and `pyannote` in particular).
